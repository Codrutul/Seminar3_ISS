Good morning, my dear journal!

Today is a very sunny day and I am very excited to go to school because I will present a project about golden retrievers!
I made a project about my best friend Lucky.

After waking up, I quickly washed my face and brushed my teeth.
Afterwards, I ate some delicious breakfast made by my grandmother.
My father is waiting for me to get ready so he can drive me to school.
My mother gave me a quick kiss and I was off!
It's going to be a good day.

Tema v-ati facut-o? (nu, dar nu-i spun asta)

Am intrat in laboratorul de biologie.
Am fost fascinat de toate imaginile de pe pereti.
S-a dezmembrat scheletele pe mine

Am o securie pentru a bate balaurul
It's already dark outside. I eat dinner and take a shower. Then I go to sleep.
